# PaperChute Website

## The PaperChute Website was designed for functionality over looks
  * It contains more PHP than any other language for functionality
  * JavaScript is used for validation of the forms on the site using a mixture of jQuery and jQuery-UI
  * jQuery-UI was used to make the development of simple little features much faster compared to making the features from scratch
  * Encryption is used to secure a user's username and password into a 96-character string for security. Here we'll let you try and crack a simple one:  601687279145abde0fbde66a7562674e3c32557ce41e55ecc835acbeefc8cb700ed9001d16036035a662788929c63262
  * Couldn't get it? Well then, the text is "ChutesPaper" *congrats if you got it right!* ("Chutes" being the password and "Paper" being the username)

## The Visual Design is Meant to be Simple
  * Even though the CSS file associated with PaperChute is quite long, the design of the site was meant to be quite simple, we made it that way so the design could be compared to paper
  * The design has been shown to many people to try and improve on the design and the simplicity of the site
  * We have reviewed the CSS and we tried to write the CSS in a more logical manner than before

## Website Creation
  * The two creators of the website are:
    1. Dillon Fancher: front-end development which contains CSS and HTML
    2. Nate Madison: back-end development which contains PHP, JavaScript, SQL, and database management
  * The website started from us discussing some name for a company name, then Nate thought of the idea of using PaperChute since it was spelled near to Parachute. Dillon agreed that the name would be fine, so they stuck with the idea of using that name. Time was needed for the team members to find a way to complete queries with PHP, they eventually found a way after a few days of searching. Once they implemented the technique into PaperChute then boosted the functionality of the website over a couple of weeks. Once functionality was nearly done, then they styled the site to its current apperance. Later, Nate implemented JavaScript to add some better User Interface for the forms. Once they discovered how unsecure storing the actual password is, encryption was enforced on any new username and password.
